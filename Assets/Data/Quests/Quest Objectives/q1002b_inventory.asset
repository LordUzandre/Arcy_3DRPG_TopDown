  descriptionText: ' You run into a willy nilly silly old bear, stuffed with fluff.
    He seems to have misplaced his jar of "hunny", whatever that is. (He was not
    very specific). All he told you was that it was yellow, sticky and very sweet.
    Have a look around and see if you can find some for him.'
