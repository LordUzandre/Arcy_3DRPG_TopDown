  description:
  - ' You run into a willy nilly silly old bear, stuffed with fluff. He seems to
    have misplaced his jar of "hunny", whatever that is, he was not very specific.
    All he told you was that it was yellow, sticky and very sweet. Have a look around
    and see if you can find some for him.'
